	"age": 30,
	"location": "Tokyo"
}
```

**Reponses:**
---
**201 (OK)**
If you successfully register a user, the endpoint will return an HTTP reponse with status code 201 and a JSON representation of the new user that was created such as below
```javascript
{
    "id": 3,
    "username": "test2",
    "name": "dan",
    "role": "viewer",
    "age": 30,
    "location": "Tokyo"
}
```
***
**404 (Bad Request)**
If you try to register a user without a username, password, role, or name, the endpoint will return an HTTP response with status code 404 and a message such as below
```javascript
{
    "message": "Please provide at least username, password, role, name for a new user"
}
```
***
**500 (Internal Server Error)**
The most likely cause for this is registering a duplicate username.  You'll get back an HTTP response with status cod 500 and the following object

}
```

If you successfully login a user, the endpoing will return a status code of 200 and an object with a welcome message, and a json web token.

The object returned will look like:
```javascript

    "message": "Welcome <username>!, here's your token",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoxLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QxIiwicm9sZSI6InZpZXdlciIsImlhdCI6MTU1MjE1MDE4MSwiZXhwIjoxNTUyMjM2NTgxfQ.xAMg_VX1LstUcL0PJLJYJGEwZ9dkehHx_ZWAc4UzT5s"
}
```

After a succesfful response, you'll want to store the token in localStorage, for later use in accessing protected resources.

```

## Get photos by user_id
*HTTP METHOD: [GET]*
*URL: /api/photos/all/:id*

**Reponses**
---
**200 (OK)**
If you successfully fetch the photos, the endpoints will return an HTTP response with a status of 200 and a array of photo objects such as below.  These photos will only be the ones that belong to the :id parameter which is the user's id.  So `/api/photos/all/1` will return all of the photos in the database belonging to user 1.
```javascript
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "user_id": 1,
        "location": "tokyo",
        "description": "downtown tokyo from above",
        "img_url": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/n-tokyo-a-20180715-870x580.jpg",
        "created_at": "2019-03-10 23:55:12",
        "updated_at": "2019-03-10 23:55:12"
    },
]
```
---
**401 (Unauthorized)**
There are two reasons you might get this response.  First, if a token (the one automatically generated by the backend upon login) is not provided along with the request, you'll get the 401 error and the following message.
```javascript
{ message: 'You need a token to acccess this resource' }
```
If for some reason, the token provided does not match the token that is passed with the request, you'll get the following message.  This will happen if a token is provided, but not the correct token.  Usually, this is caused by the user trying to modify the token.
```javascript
{ message: 'Modifying my token are you? '}
```

**403 (Forbidden)**
A 403 error means that the user does have the correct role to access the resource.  This resource is protected and only users with `role: expat` can access it.  If a user with any other role tries to access this endpoint, they'll get the following message:
```javascript
{ message: 'You do not have the right type of role to access this resource' }
```
